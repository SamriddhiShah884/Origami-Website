   Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has applications in the modern-day
    classroom for teaching geometry, thinking skills, fractions, problem 
    solving, and fun science. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, is
     making a comeback. While some of the oldest pieces of origami have been found 
     in ancient China and its deepest roots are in ancient Japan, origami can make an
      impact in today's education too. This art form engages students and sneakily enhances
       their skills -- including
     improved spatial perception and logical and sequential thinking.
     Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve 
     spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning. Such skills allow children
      to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for the world around
       them. In your class, find origami or geometric shapes in nature and then describe
        them with geometric terms.

        The concept of fractions is scary to lots of students. Folding paper can demonstrate 
        the fractions in a tactile way. In your class, you can use origami to illustrate 
        the concepts of one-half, one-third, or one-fourth by folding paper and asking how
         many folds students would need to make a certain shape. The act of folding the paper
          in half and in half again and so on can also be used to demonstrate the concept of infinity.
          Often in assignments, there is one set answer and one way to get there. Origami 
          provides children an opportunity to solve something that isn't prescribed and 
          gives them a chance to make friends with failure (i.e. trial and error). 
          In your class, show a shape and ask students to come up with a way to make it.
           They may get the solution from various approaches. Remember, there is no wrong answer.
